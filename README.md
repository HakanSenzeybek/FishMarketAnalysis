# FishMarketAnalysis

Objective:
Fish is an important source of food for many people around the world. Understanding the factors that contribute to the success of the fishing industry can be useful for policymakers and researchers. In this project, we will analyze the Fish Market dataset to identify the factors that contribute to the weight of fish caught and make predictions about the weight of fish based on these factors.

About the Dataset:
The Fish Market dataset is a collection of data on different fish species caught in the Central Market of the Portuguese city of Matosinhos. The dataset contains information on seven different fish species, including their weight, length, height, width, and other features.

Methodology:
The first step in the analysis was to explore the dataset and identify any missing or invalid values. We then visualized the data to identify any patterns or trends that could help us understand the factors that contribute to the weight of fish. We used different regression models to make predictions about the weight of fish based on the other features in the dataset. We also applied regularization techniques such as Lasso to reduce overfitting in the models.

Results:
Our analysis of the Fish Market dataset revealed that the length and height of the fish have a significant impact on their weight. We were able to build accurate regression models to predict the weight of fish based on these factors. The Lasso regularization technique helped us improve the accuracy of our models and avoid overfitting.

Conclusion:
Our analysis of the Fish Market dataset shows that the length and height of fish are important factors in determining their weight. This information can be useful for policymakers and researchers working in the fishing industry to develop strategies to improve fish yield. The use of regularization techniques such as Lasso can help improve the accuracy of predictions and avoid overfitting in regression models.
